## Real Time solution to make backward compatible app for frequent changing form-views
- Create forms (Views) from a JSON for user can fill data and submit.
- The JSON is to be fetched from API, such that it will always render the updated JSON and hence the form will always be updated.

## To Do
- Open a webview having a webpage that helps drag and drop of HTML elements to create discrete form as needed.
- A generate button will read the structure and generate the respective JSON
- An input box that accepts this formatted JSON and create the form out of that raw JSON to verify the old JSON
- Convert the JSON for Mob app rendering
